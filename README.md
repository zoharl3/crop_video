# Crop a video
A python script to crop a video from the command line.

After recording, I needed to cut out some clips from the video. I couldn't find a simple tool to do that, so I wrote this. 

# Usage
I go over a video with a player (e.g., smplayer), and I write down in a text file all the time segments that I'd like to crop. The script takes the file as input and generates a new video.

Currently, the parameter `base` is hard coded and need to be manually changed in the script. If someone finds the script useful, then let me know, and I'll tidy it up.
